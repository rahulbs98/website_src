      <div class="home-about-content">
        <p>I got into cryptography through the realization that mathematics can protect people. Starting with the theory, I became obsessed with a deceptively simple question: does this security proof actually matter in practice? That led me to secure multiparty computation and privacy-enhancing technologies. My PhD work is essentially an attempt to answer that—designing protocols that are both rigorously proven and actually deployable. I'm driven by the idea that we can compute collaboratively without anyone compromising their data, and I'm working to make that practical at scale. Right now, my research focuses on structured MPC settings with realistic trust assumptions, but I'm increasingly focused on moving from theoretical guarantees to systems that work in the real world.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, you'll find me exploring cities with a camera, eating my way through local food scenes (vegan-leaning), or walking for hours—often my best ideas come during those walks. I've been fortunate to live and work across Tel Aviv, Copenhagen, Goa, Bangalore, and Tokyo, and travel has become central to how I think. Photography, especially capturing architecture and urban environments, taught me to see systems differently—how pieces fit, where tension exists, how designs fail or succeed. I'm deeply interested in education and privacy adoption, and I'm actively looking to contribute to those spaces. My goal is to build bridges between the theoretical work I'm doing now and practical problems that matter—making cryptographic tools accessible to those who need them.</p>
